Well, thank you, Ken and Steve and thank you for getting the company to where we are today
Now as all of you might imagine, Ken and Steve have a lot of people to talk to about this news, employees, customers, partners, the media and many more
So we're going to let them go off to attend all of these discussions and Toby and I will stay here to talk to you about our latest financial results and outlook
I would start by building on what both Ken and Steve said in their remarks and you can see in our performance that our simple financial model is working
We are driving revenue growth across our diverse business, leveraging our fixed cost base to drive expense efficiencies and steadily returning capital to shareholders, all of which are combining to drive the type of steady EPS performance for which American Express has long been known
With this as context, let's turn our attention to Slide 3 of our investor presentation where we will jump into our third quarter results
Revenue of $8.4 billion was up 9% versus the third quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of FX where the dollar weakened a bit and versus the prior year for the first time in a while adjusted revenue growth was 8% consistent with the adjusted revenue growth rate from Q2 2017. I'll come back to the drivers of revenue growth in a few minutes, but we are pleased with our steady performance across the different customer segments we serve and the different geographies in which we operate
Net income grew 19% in the quarter while earnings per share was $1.50 up 25% from the third quarter of 2016 as we continue to steadily buybacks shares
Looking at the income statement many of you will have noted that we had an unusually low tax rate of roughly 26% this quarter
The lower tax rate results primarily from the realization of certain foreign tax credits in the current quarter as well as an ongoing shift in the geographic mix of our earnings
In the quarter we also incurred discrete charges related to our U.S
loyalty coalition business, our U.S
prepaid business and the recent hurricanes in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico
I'll provide a bit more detail on these later in my remarks, but the aggregate impact of these discrete charges equates to approximately $0.12 of earnings per share
So looking at both the lower tax rate and these discrete charges together the net impact to EPS is minimal and we believe the third quarter EPS of $1.50 is a good indicator of the underlying core performance of the business
These results brought our return on equity for the 12 months ending in September to 23%
This ROE performance is below our historical performance primarily due to the uneven quarterly earnings we experienced last year in 2016. If you simply look at our expected earnings range for the full year 2017 and our equity position, our ROE should trend back towards our historical level as we end the year
Moving now to our metrics starting with billed business performance trends which you see several views of on Slides 4 through 6. Worldwide FX adjusted Billings grew 8% in the quarter versus the prior year consistent with the adjusted growth rate over the last few quarters
And when we look at the segment view on Slide 5 you see consistent performance across the segments this quarter
Moving to Slide 6, we have added view of billings growth bringing together several ways we have talked about our broad ranging growth opportunities in recent years
Before we get into the details, let me remind you that our global commercial and global consumer segments are roughly the same size representing 40% and 43% of billings respectively
Global Network Services makes up the remaining 17% of billings
Within the global commercial segment the first two bars represent customers who are small and midsized enterprises or SMEs defined as clients with less than $300 million in annual revenues
We have consistently seen strong growth of SMEs and this continued in the third quarter
SME billings grew at 10% in the third quarter while international SME which has been one of our highest growth areas recently was even more robust with FX adjusted growth of 15%
The large and global customer segment grew at 5% on an FX adjusted basis this quarter up modestly from prior quarters
This customer group represents just 10% of our overall billings but is critical from a scale and relevance perspective, although we expect this segment to show more modest growth rates
Within global consumer the U.S
represents around 31% of the company's billings and is growing at 7%
consumer premium space remains competitive, we are seeing strong results in our U.S
consumer platinum franchise
consumer platinum volumes and the card member numbers continue to be at record levels since we rolled out new features and benefits starting in Q4 last year
International consumer is up 13% on an FX adjusted basis driven by our operations in countries such as Japan, the UK and Australia all of which are up 18% to 19% adjusted for FX
Keep in mind that these volumes represent our proprietary cards with a closed loop model enables us to offer strong value propositions that are driving billings moment
Finally, FX adjusted billings growth for our network business was 4% a modest slow down from last quarter and in line with our expectations
As we've said before with evolving regulations in Europe and Australia, we expect network volumes in those geographies to decline over time
As we adapt to these new regulations, we would expect our proprietary international billings to grow faster the network partner billings
Overall, we feel good about all the diverse sources of growth across our business segments and geographies
Although we have some headwinds from regulation in markets around the world and intense competition in the U.S
we are particularly excited about the opportunities we have in high growth areas like SME and international consumer which reflect the diversity of our business model
Turning next to loan performance on Slide 7, our loan growth accelerated to 14% on a reported basis and to 13% on an FX adjusted basis
Once again more than 50% of the new loans added to our portfolio are coming from existing customers this quarter in line with the strategy we first laid out in early 2016. Before we get into our lending metrics, I thought it would be helpful to take a step back and review our overall lending strategy which as a reminder drives just a modest portion of our overall revenues with net interest income coming in at 20% of our total Q3 revenues
Over the last several years and in particular with the portfolio sales last year, the mix of our loan book has changed with cobrand card loans representing a smaller portion of the portfolio and AMEX branded card loans making up a greater portion of the portfolio
This shift in our portfolio leads to higher yields and as we have said before also higher lost rates
Taken together this generates attractive lending economics and you see the individual dynamics playing out across both our yield and lending credit metrics
For example, on the right side of Slide 07, you can see net interest yield increased again sequentially to 10.7%
The shift in the portfolio I just described is one of the drivers of this steady sequential increase along with a few other factors we mentioned last quarter, including a shift in the mix of revolving loans towards higher APRâ€™s including having a smaller portion at introductory rates, pricing actions taking in recent quarters, and benchmark interest rates increasing more than our overall funding costs
We are pleased with our progress here, though at some point we expect net interest margin to stabilize and as a result we expect the year-over-year growth in net interest income to slow from current levels
Turning next to credit metrics, on Slide 08 you see the upward trend as expected consistent with the same shift in the portfolio I just described
The worldwide lending write off rate was 1.8% for the quarter
Let me remind you that if you compare it to last year, the write off rate in Q3, 2016 was slightly elevated due to Costco loans that were not sold as part of the portfolio sale
In the third quarter the delinquency rate was 1.3% in line with our expectations and again higher than the prior year due primarily to the mix shift in the loan portfolio
Moving to Slide 9 provision expense for the quarter is $769 million and you can clearly see that we continue to build reserves to account for the growth in loans which has exceeded our expectations as well as the related seasoning in our loan portfolio and the mix shift towards AMEX branded products that I just discussed
A small part of the reserve build also relates to the hurricanes which we estimated at around $20 million in the quarter
This does include an estimate for Puerto Rico where we have a more limited amount of information available
We are of course doing many things to support our card members and merchants and we'll closely monitor the situation in the coming months
Looking forward, we continue to expect provision to grow at a higher rate than loans as we progress on our lending strategy
So I would expect the year-over-year growth rate in Q4 to move down towards the average for the full year
We feel good about the trade off between risk in the portfolio, profitability and growth and believe we have a long runway to grow our share of our customers' borrowing behaviours
Turning to our revenue performance, on Slide 10 FX adjusted revenue was up 8%
We are pleased with another quarter of strong revenue growth coming from a broad range of diverse business opportunities
Looking now at the components of revenue on Slide 11, first discount revenue was up 6% driven by the strong growth in billed business
Net card fees growth was 5%
If you look back to the third quarter last year we had a small non-recurring benefit that we are growing over this quarter
Considering this, our growth this quarter remains consistent with our recent trends
This quarter also had a very small impact from the platinum fee increase for existing U.S
consumer card members since the results would only show a one month impact for card members whose anniversary date is in September
While it is still early we are pleased to see strong card member engagement, acquisition and renewal trends with the refreshed U.S
consumer platinum value proposition
Other fees and commissions grew 11% in the second quarter while other revenues declined by 10%
The decline in other revenues was primarily driven by prior year revenue from a small business we sold in Q4 of last year
Net interest income grew by 26% driven by the higher net interest yield, we discussed earlier and higher adjusted loan balances
Turning to discount rate, on Slide 12 the reported discount rate was 2.42% down five basis points from the prior year and the ratio of discount revenue to billed business was 1.76% down four basis points from last year
You will remember the right side of Slide 12 from our Investor Day this March where we talked about the factors driving erosion in our discount rate
The biggest drivers of erosion in the third quarter were merchant specific negotiations across the globe and our OptBlue efforts in the U.S
consistent with what we described at the Investor Day in March
In addition to the drivers we described in March, we did see a slightly larger than expected impact from mix in part due to strong growth outside the U.S
Turning now to expenses on Slide 13, performance varied across the lines and I'll discuss changes to the marketing and promotion rewards and card member services expenses when I come back to spending on card member engagement in just a minute
But first let me cover operating expenses
Total operating expenses were flat to the prior year; however, as I mentioned earlier, there were discrete charges impacting operating expense both this year and last year
In Q3, â€™16 we incurred a restructuring charge related to our initiatives to remove $1 billion from our cost base
In Q3, â€™17 we took discrete charges related to our U.S
loyalty coalition business and our U.S
prepaid business
loyalty business, you may have recently seen announcement from certain founding partners of Plenti regarding their future loyalty plans
Given these changes, we are in confidential discussions with the few remaining Plenti sponsors regarding the future of the program
As a result of these partner announcements and the evolving state of the U.S
program, we have taken an impairment charge and a related restructuring charge for the U.S
loyalty coalition business this quarter
Before moving on, I would remind you that we run a similar program Payback in five other countries with a particularly well established long running program in Germany
prepaid business, the charges were related to the recently announced distribution agreement with Inca [ph]
Total operating expenses adjusted for these discrete charges in both years declined by 4% consistent with the year-over-year change on an adjusted basis that we saw in Q2. We are making solid progress on our cost reduction initiatives and we remain confident that we will remove $1 billion from the company's cost base on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. As we have previously mentioned, given our revenue performance and accelerated progress on our cost savings initiatives, we have taken the opportunity to selectively reinvest into areas of the business that we believe will help drive continued revenue growth going forward
Finally on Slide 13 as I previously discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% down from 34% a year ago due primarily to the realization of certain foreign tax credits in the current year and an ongoing shift in the geographic mix of earnings
Going forward, we estimate our ongoing tax rate will be approximately 32% given the changes to our geographic mix of earnings
Of course the rate in any given period can be further impacted by discrete tax items as we saw in Q3. Moving to the summary of our card member engagement spending on Slide 14, total engagement spending in Q3 was $3.1 billion flat sequentially and up 11% versus the prior year
Looking at the components of that spending M&P was down 12% versus Q3 â€™16. As a reminder, we expect marketing and promotion to be down significantly for the full year relative to 2016 as we realize efficiencies in our marketing spend and move beyond the unique investment opportunities we had in the second half of 2016. I would point out that given our overall strong financial performance year-to-date, we have chosen to selectively reinvest into growth opportunities for the medium to long term
As we look at the effectiveness of our marketing spend, we continue to see good progress in attracting new customers
In the quarter, we added 2.6 million new proprietary customers globally
In our global consumer business over two thirds of new customer acquisition came through digital channels and over 35% of new customers were Millennials
Rewards expense increased 21% in Q3 while proprietary billings grew by 9% versus last year
This growth in rewards resulted in a ratio of rewards cost proprietary billings of 84 basis points which is up from the prior year, but down two basis points from the prior quarter
The year-over-year increase in rewards expense during the quarter reflects the impact of the enhancements to our U.S
platinum products that we implemented in Q4 â€™16 as well as strong growth in our Delta cobrand portfolio
Cost of card member services in the quarter increased 31% reflecting higher engagement levels across our premium travel services including airport lounge access and cobrand benefits such as first bag free on Delta as well as usage of the new Uber benefit on platinum
This remains an area where we offer differentiated benefits and we plan to continue to invest in Card Member Services
Turning now to of capital in Slide 15, we continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends
We've returned 97% of the capital we've generated thus far in 2017 to shareholders which has driven a 5% reduction in our average shares outstanding versus the prior year
The third quarter common equity Tier 1 capital ratio moved down sequentially to 11.9% in line with our expectations and driven by growth in the balance sheet and the fact that we've returned 115% of the capital generated this quarter
We are confident that the strength of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios in accordance with the annual CCAR review
To summarize, over the past few years, we've embarked on a series of initiatives to reposition the company and drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth
These efforts have been targeted at providing a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer term
We are seeing the payoff in our 2017 results with the strong and consistent performance over the first three quarters
Given these strong results and where we are in the year, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.80 to $5.90. we are pleased to be able to both raise our earnings expectations while also funding some incremental investments aimed at driving moderate to long term results
It has long been our practice to balance the financial commitments we have in the short term which we take very seriously with the opportunities we see to invest and build for the longer term
As we go forward, we are focused on delivering steady and consistent earnings growth, building upon the range of growth opportunities that we see across our diverse customer segments and geographies
With that, let me turn it back over to Toby as we move to Q&A
Yes, so thank you Sanjay for the question and a couple of comments
First, I'd remind everyone that I've often said there's a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter in the provision, so I encourage people to think a little bit about the longer term trends
If you look at year-to-date the provisions are up 37% loans are up 14% and as I said I would expect the year-over-year increase provision to look more like that year-to-date number in Q4. Next thing I'd say is, remember there's a real tie here if you think about this shift that has occurred in our loan portfolio between the yields, the write off rates and so one of the inflection points in our growth rates was around 18 to 24 months ago and we were very focused on all the changes occurring as we went through the transitions around our cobrand portfolios
A lot of the newer accounts that we acquired in that time are just hitting sort of a key point in the seasoning timeline 18 to 24 months and frankly that's part of what's driving yield up as they come off introductory rates and start paying off, and frankly that's also what's giving us a little visibility into what the right future expected write offs are and that's a little bit of what drove the provision up this quarter
So I think it's very important to keep those two things in mind we're getting attractive economics overall
As I think about net write-offs going forward, I think Sanjay if you think back we in early â€™16 seeing all the changes we were making began to say that we'd expect to see modest steady upward drift as we grow a little bit above the industry and as that drives the inevitable seasoning of the portfolio any bigger portion of the portfolio being lower tenure, that actually didn't happen much in 2016 has now begun to happen in 2017 and I really expect similar trends to continue as we get into 2018. So hopefully that helps on the provision
Hi Craig
Yes, you are right
They will read every word of the transcript
Yes, itâ€™s an excellent question Craig and I think this really goes to the unusually broad range of both customer segments and geographies that our business encompasses
And so yes, as we have had stronger financial performance than we've expected this year we are putting a little bit to the bottom line and that's the increase in guidance and we're also putting a little bit into the M&P line and a little bit into some things that are in OpEx
And if you think about that, where the particularly high growth areas that we've seen lately, well in particular I called out in my remarks, the small and medium sized enterprise space both in the U.S
and internationally as well as the proprietary international consumer space
And so, those are - we see those as particularly good growth opportunities for us and as we have thought about where might there be a really good return over the medium to long term spending a little bit of incremental resource is those kind of areas and some of that goes into M&P and some of it also goes in OpEx
Right? When you start talking about the commercial space you're often talking about sales people who run through OpEx, youâ€™re talking about how we use our call centers to help drive more volumes that time and that runs through OpEx, so it's a mixture
But we are as you would expect being very thoughtful about putting incremental dollars only in those places where we think there are particularly good returns for us right now and where we have a unique position or unique advantage
Yes, so boy there's a lot there in that question and I think
Let me start with revenues and then work my way to the bottom line
We're really pleased by the 8% revenue growth that we've seen the last two quarters and we have tremendous momentum across all of our businesses just like they did last quarter
I have pointed out that at some point the tremendous sequential growth you've seen in our net interest field will start to plateau and slow down a little bit and that will have an effect of slowing the revenue growth rate a little bit
Not calling out exactly when that turn happens it sort of didn't happen this quarter, but at some point it will slow us down a little bit
Similarly in 2017 thus far you've seen a particularly nice uplift in the U.S
from both the consumer and the business platinum value proposition changes we made late last year and early this year
At some point again, you will begin to lap those, although I would remind you on a consumer platinum product that is a long lapping process because the fee increase for existing customers only went into effect beginning with customers who had their renewal dates in September, so it will actually play out over the next, the way the accounting works, the next 24 months
So those two things over time will put a little bit of downward pressure on the current momentum you have at 8%
Now you also somethingâ€™s next year that will go the other way, so we are really pleased with the announcement we made along with Hilton a few months ago that point we will have an expanded partnership with Hilton in 2018 and we will become the sole cobrand provider and that will certainly provide some incremental revenue opportunities for us in 2018. I would be remiss if I didn't point out that as you would expect for cobrand renewals in recent years that also comes with the margin compression we're very pleased with that opportunity
So exactly were all that comes out in 2018 in terms of revenue growth we'll give you an update on the January call, but we feel good about the momentum and those are probably the three things that at the margin to move it a little up and a little down as you get into next year
And I guess I should also point out I'm making all my comments ignoring any changes that new rev reg rules might cause which would just be geography anyway
Bottom line look I think we have a long track record that we are showing renewed vigor on this year in that our model let's us get tremendous expense leverage and the kind of spend centric model we have does not require a lot of capital support balance growth each year which lets us do lots of share repurchase and payment of dividend
So that's the model and we should consistently be able to turn good revenue growth into even better EPS growth exactly what that looks like for 2018 we'll let you know as we get into the January earnings call
Thanks Ryan
So just the level set for everyone itâ€™s for us if you think about the 100 basis points that the Fed has raised rates over the last almost two years, weâ€™ve as they have gone up, as the Fed has gone up 100 basis points weâ€™ve raised rates on our personal savings programs about 35 basis points, so that certainly has been a big positive for our results
Now I would not expect the beta if you were to remain at 0.35 forever going forward
On many occasions in these calls, I have talked about a 0.7 beta over the longer term that we use in a lot of our modelling
Obviously, you will have to see exactly where the industry grows, our goal would remain competitive
In terms of balances, for the last couple of years Betsy, we've said we're kind of comfortable where we were because we want to remain very active in both the asset backed securities market as well as the unsecured market and being active in all three markets is an important part of our funding strategy
I would say as we get into the latter part of 2018 and beyond, I would expect to see us growing personal savings again at levels that we haven't in a number of the years
And so thatâ€™s not something you'll see next quarter or early 2018 but I would say over the course of the next 12 to 18 months you will see some significant growth there exactly how much will be a little bit of a function of where the rate environment goes both in terms of the base level of what the Fed does as well as what the competitive market does for these kinds of online accounts
Well, the way we really think about it Betsy is I come back to given our mix of business, we probably think of it less as a loan to deposit ratio and we think of - we want a funding strategy that creates a balance of being diversified across different sources in different markets so that from a security and installment perspective no matter what happens in the capital markets, we have good access to capital and we want to do that while also being efficient about funding our diverse business model
And I think what people forget sometimes is because we have a big international business, because we have a corporate card business, our funding structure requires that we access different sources of funding in different places that our funding is not all fundable
So thatâ€™s really how we approach it and what I say is the personal savings rate or number which has been in the $30 billion number for a while range that is a number that I would expect to go up over the next 12 to 24 months
Well there's probably two questions there
First, gosh I'm going to go back to the thing Ken and Steve said
Steve's story has worked hand in hand with Ken now for 32 years and has been intimately involved in every change that we've made in particular over the last couple of years
So I don't think we missed a beat on any aspect of running the business
As I say that I also think it's important to remind you Steveâ€™s words that we fully understand though that doesn't mean you don't constantly have to change, you can't stand still
So I feel really good about all that
In terms of Marriott and SPG, look we said for a long time that there are three possible outcomes here
Right? Marriott chooses to keep two cobrand partners they go with the other cobrand partner or they go with us
I will acknowledge we are the smaller of the two partners, on the other hand Marriott has made a lot of public statements here about the fact that they want to bring the two programs together next year, that our contract doesn't expire until 2020, the other cobrand bank, their contract expires next year
So we have been working really hard to demonstrate the tremendous value that the range of travel assets we have consumer travel agencies, business travel agency a huge membership reward program, a premium oriented customer base, we think goes a really tremendous assets when you're talking about a travel cobrand we think they've been a really important part of what has made SPG a really powerful program and I think Marriott is very focused on making sure they keep the loyalty and the engagement of all those SPG card members and we would love to be a part of it
So still we will have to see where it goes but I don't think we'll miss a beat there
Well you are completely accurately recalling my comments, the public comments from your conference a little bit ago
I think the important word here which they tried to replicate in my remarks earlier this afternoon are that at some point obviously you can't raise your net interest yield forever
At some point it has to plateau now weâ€™re working hard to try to continue to do smart things that are consistent with building long term customer engagement and loyalty that will continue to drive net interest yield up, but at some point it will plateau, now we're wIâ€™m not calling exactly when that happens and it certainly did not happened this quarter and we're really pleased with the momentum we have
Thanks Mark
Well, believe me it is a focus and yes, I don't know the exact math, you just yes directionally you're correct, the thing you need to remember we made a very conscious decision late last year, early this year to make some significant value proposition enhancements in the U.S
in both the business platinum card and the consumer platinum card and those are both very substantial and material franchises for us
So it worked tremendously well, we've really exceeded our own expectations even in terms of card member engagement and new card member acquisition as well as continued really de minimis attrition rates
Until you are done lapping that increase in rewards cost, you get the effect you just described on discount revenue overall
So look there it is a competitive environment in all the markets we serve, but particularly competitive in the U.S
consumer space, but once you're done lapping these, you should begin to see a little different trend when you do the calculation that you just described and certainly our goal across the globe is to get that discount revenue net of rewards number growing consistently
Yes, but when you're looking at year-over-year growth remember you have a big step-up in the rewards cost this year and a kind of what I'm going to call standard step up in discount revenue and what we would expect to see once you've done lapping that as you're still on the same somewhat similar trajectory in terms of your gross discount revenues but growing but your rewards costs don't have the huge spike in growth that they have this year
If you think about it that the in my remarks I think the numbers I called out were or its costs are up 19% well the 21% while the associated billings are up much less
So that relationship as we go into the next quarter or two will get much more aligned again and that will change the phenomenon you described
The reserving process can [indiscernible] went through in great detail and as it is both a heavily regulated process not just by the usual accounting standards you would expect but also heavily by our regulators and some what we do is very much driven by them
Look there's no question this was a big reserve build this quarter
What I keep coming back to is the when you put aside there's a little quarter-to-quarter volatility and you look at this over any given couple of quarters we're trending as we would have expected
We are pleased with the loan growth we are seeing overall
The shift in portfolio mix is an important part of what is driving tremendous growth and net interest yield and that comes with some growth in the write offs and we are getting as I explained earlier to this point where A significant number of the newer accounts we brought on 18 to 24 months ago are getting to be a key part of the time line as they season and so we're building some reserves for that and that's part of what's driving the yield up as well
So there is really not a lot more to the storey
I mean, yes we certainly look at what kind of coverage we have going forward, although we've made different judgments and charts versus lends in different parts of the world
But we feel good about the reserves
We think they're conservative and we feel good about the overall economics that we're getting from our lending
Thanks
Yes, so I you know, yes you're right most of the - there was a small sequential decline, I think what you're calling out is the ratio of the rewards costs to the billings, there's a little quarter-to-quarter volatility itâ€™s a very complex calculation that of course is not just US calculation but it involves lots of other international markets that youâ€™re doing the calculation by market
So you get a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter
I would not want anyone to leave the call thinking that 84 basis points is exactly what you should expect forever going forward it'll bounce up and down a few basis points each quarter
In general though, that's the range I would expect to be in given all the value propositions that we have in the marketplace today and I wouldn't point to any particular business change or anything that drove that 2 basis points sequential decline Moshe
Well, I guess Rick, let me make a few comments and they may or may not be responsive to exactly where you're going
Certainly we believe both Ken and Steve in their remarks talked about the fact that we think we have a particularly strong brand in our customers given our long standing reputation for service attach to our brand and we take that loyalty really seriously and really value it and work very hard at it
And one of the things that we've talked about on many of these calls is that sometimes people will do a pure mathematical calculation of different products that are out there in the marketplace and say gee, American Express you can't possibly compete because let's use this simplest category because your cash back card doesn't seem to be as rich as somebody else's
And yet our response to that is often well our cash back cards are doing really good in terms of new customer acquisitions
They're growing nicely and they're producing really good economics for us
And one of the things I like to point out internally is we do believe there is value in the brand
We do believe there's value in the range of services we provide and so by gosh, we should be able to get those things valued by customers and we shouldn't have to necessarily mathematically match every other aspect of the value proposition thatâ€™s some of our competitors put in the marketplace
So I think frankly Rick we see that longstanding view we have, our longstanding experience, this proves that brand does matter and loyalty does matter we work really hard at doing things that build upon that
If you think about the platinum refreshes that we've done there, very much focused on some of the aspects, the experiential aspects of the product that we think are more difficult for others to replicate in build upon some of our reputation
So thatâ€™s what we're trying to do every day
We think is what we've historically done and we think it gives us some unique advantages that are not easy for others to replicate
Yes, well, you know, gosh in a company with over $100 million card members major trends evolve slowly
Yes we're very focused on attracting more wallet share
We're also in our consumer business very focused on attracting more borrowing share and so we have clearly been making huge strides for the last several years and driving more borrowing share in terms of our card members wallets and spending sure you kind of have to look at it by market by commercial versus consumer
I often say Rick, our goal is to ultimately maximize our financial returns and to maximize our revenue share and we pay attention to our wallet share
We pay attention to our share of billings
We pay attention to our share of lending and certainly in the U.S
consumer space we're growing share like crazy in our share of lending
But we're not always trying to maximize every one of those if we don't think it's economic
So we feel good about our revenue performance and we think it's building on a good economics for us so
Yes, so couple comments
Yes, we see tremendous growth opportunities that will last a very, very long time in the SME space because the point we try to make over and over and over to people as far as you know is that in that space weâ€™re often competing against just trying to get small and mid-sized enterprises to put more of their payment needs onto the card and it's frankly less about the competition, less about some of the highly competitive rewards competition we face elsewhere and the growth rates youâ€™ve seen in both the U.S
and international SME segments have been very high for some number of years
They're driven by our continual ability to work with small and mid-sized enterprises to drive more spend onto the card and we think despite that we've only captured a small fraction of their spend and we can keep at this for years
Similarly when you go outside the U.S
, but because of evolving regulation in Europe, in Australia for some time let's see exactly how long it takes because there is a little bit of a wind down of the network business in those two parts of the world
Itâ€™s still growing really nicely everywhere else and it's still globally an important part of the American Express network
Right? So I don't want anyone to walk away from this call thinking it's a less important part of our company, itâ€™s really important to the global network
You're just going to see modest overall growth rates because of the step down in Europe and Australia
That very step down though in the evolving regulatory climate is part of what's helping fuel some tremendous growth rates in places like the U.K
and Australia in our proprietary card business where of course we also get a much greater share of the overall economics
So thatâ€™s a pretty good trade for us
So look, we feel really good about the hard work that it's been over the last two years to take yet another billion dollars out of the run rate of the company and we're on track, weâ€™ll get it
when you go beyond that David, what I always say is what you can always take cost out of the company, itâ€™s not always prudent though and I think when you go beyond 2017, the way to think about it is in a world where we're seeing the kind of revenue growth now we can support that and we will support that with very little growth in operating expenses and so thatâ€™s a tremendous ongoing story of operating leverage
For now, I think saying that we're going to take out another billion dollars would probably not be prudent and we would lose more revenue than we would gain
But steady operating leverage, you should absolutely expect from us
