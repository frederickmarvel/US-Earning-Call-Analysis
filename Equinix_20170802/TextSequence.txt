And good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call
We finished the first half of 2017, with solid momentum and our success with customers is reflected in our financial performance, and ecosystem growth
We continue to grow our market share, expand our global footprint, and win new accounts on both sides of our rapidly expanding cloud ecosystem
Customers are seeing the benefit of highly interconnected IT deployments to optimize for cost, agility and performance, and the robust demand for cloud and telecom services, is driving and sustaining the next wave of campus expansions
We also closed our acquisition of Verizon's Americas data center portfolio, strengthening our global market leadership and giving us additional capacity to meet customer demand
We are seeing strong performance out of the gate for these assets, as our sales force works to expand our business with the existing customer relationships and are already booking new sales into the Verizon sites
We delivered healthy bookings in the second quarter, fueled by strong growth in our network and enterprise verticals, and in the European region
As depicted on slide 3, second quarter revenues eclipsed a $1 billion for the first time, to $1.066 billion up 11% over the same quarter last year, on a normalized and constant currency basis
Adjusted EBITDA was $509 million for the quarter, up 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis
AFFO growth was 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, the result of strong operating performance
With the Verizon acquisition, we now service 42% of the Fortune 500 and 30% of the Global 2000 and are expanding our traction with these critical lighthouse accounts
Three region deployments continue to rise
This quarter, over 58% of our revenue came from customers deployed across all three regions, and 84% came from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 83% last quarter
Interconnection revenue grew 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, significantly outpacing colocation revenues and reflecting the movement towards Interconnected Oriented Architectures (sic) [Interconnection Oriented Architectures] and the rapid adoption of hybrid cloud and multi-cloud as the preferred IT deployment model
We saw a healthy pace of cross-connect adds with over 242,000 cross-connects now deployed excluding the Verizon assets
Traction with Equinix Cloud Exchange and Internet Exchange also continues as we build our platform Equinix as the most comprehensive platform to access a variety of networks in a rapidly expanding universe of cloud providers
In the second quarter, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Salesforce all expanded into new metros on cloud exchange and we added key new providers including Alibaba and Tencent
We now service approximately 900 Cloud Exchange customers
Enterprises of all types increasingly regard private, secure, distributed interconnection as a core design principle of IT and are leveraging our entire product portfolio
We look forward to making some new announcements in the second half regarding our expansion of our interconnection capabilities both in terms of enhanced reach and compelling feature functionality for our customers
Turning now to acquisitions
Our acquisition of Verizon's 29 data centers dramatically boost our efforts to grow in scale in the Americas, enhancing our interconnection capabilities with core strategic hubs in 15 metros
We plan to integrate and substantially invest in these assets, which will help us reduce their historical churn
In overlap markets, we are in the process of building fiber connections between new Verizon assets and existing campuses as an early step in the integration, and we'll introduce our products and services at these locations over time
Verizon adds more than 600 net new customers to our global platform and we allocated those accounts to the existing sales teams to begin building these relationships
We're already seeing early success in cross-selling our platform with significant positive feedback from these customers as we look to drive growth in this portfolio
The Verizon deal also fueled expansion in three new cities: Bogotá, Culpeper, and Houston
The new market of Bogotá, Colombia, extends our presence in this growing market, which is now has the most undersea cable landings in Latin America
Our entry into Houston positions us to build on our success in the energy ecosystem, a market with deep global requirements and a demonstrated appetite for hybrid cloud solutions
And the acquisition of the Culpeper facilities in Virginia gives us meaningful future expansion capability and enables us to accelerate our business in the federal government sector, which doubles with the Verizon acquisition
Both the Culpeper and Miami's NAP of the Americas campus advances our name recognition, federal team size, and ability to access existing federal contracts
As government agencies modernize and migrate to the cloud, Equinix offers compliance, scale, and security advantages that we believe will drive continued success in this massive market
Now, let me comment on our development activity
We recently opened three new IBXs, expanding Equinix's total global footprint to 182 data centers across 44 markets
These new facilities add owned capacity in some of our most important and interconnection-rich campuses and expand our footprint to support the growing demand for cloud services and interconnection
In Germany, we opened Frankfurt 6 a new IBX located on owned land next to Frankfurt 4 and tethered to our Frankfurt 5 hub, one of the most carrier dense locations in Europe
This supports our scaling in one of Europe's leading financial centers and help for banking, commerce, and manufacturing
We also opened Silicon Valley 10 adding owned capacity to our network dense San Jose campus, which serves one of the largest concentrations of high-tech companies and peering hubs in the world
SV10 is next to our SV1 and SV5 facilities, which form the core interconnection hub in South San Jose
It's the first build on 11 acres of land, purchased by Equinix in 2016 with room for an additional 2,700 cabinet data center
And we opened Amsterdam 4 adjacent to our existing AM3 facility in the Amsterdam Science Park
AM4 builds out one of the most cloud dense locations in Europe, helping us meet the growing demand for interconnection and colocation in the Netherlands as a key launch pad for serving the continent
It also leverages the latest green technology, meeting our rigid standards for energy efficiency and helping customers reduce their carbon footprint
Revenues from owned assets jumped to 42%, up from 35% last quarter, which includes the predominantly owned Verizon portfolio
And we continue to purchase additional land and buildings
During the quarter, we acquired our Amsterdam 5 facility for $30 million, a former Telecity lease site
We also entered into an agreement to purchase our Zurich 5 facility in 2019, which includes adjacent land for future expansion
In São Paulo, we closed on the acquisition of a four-acre land parcel adjacent to our recently opened SP3 facility, which could support 2,400 cabinets of future expansion, in this critical global market
Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, and I'll start with the networks
This vertical experienced another record bookings quarter, led by international deployments, with substantial growth coming from telecom operators, wireless service providers, and subsea cable operators, as firms expand capacity and capabilities for digital services
We're seeing the global network providers undergo a major refresh of their IP infrastructure to support new capacity levels and applications across their footprints
Bookings growth includes a wide variety of global carriers, performing multi-metro expansions, including British Telecom who extended coverage of their cloud edge nodes into multiple metros as well as a leading network operator providing air-to-ground broadband services
We also had our best bookings quarter-to-date as the interconnection partner for new submarine cable projects and we see a strong pipeline for the second half
We announced our 15th subsea cable win with Eastern Light, a fiber optic cable route connecting Sweden and Finland
The Eastern Light cable combines the landing station and interconnection hub into a single solution at Equinix's Helsinki and Stockholm data centers, eliminating the need for a traditional beach cable landing station
The financial services vertical saw multi-region growth across trading, banking and financial service provider segments
Financial services firms are broadening the use of Platform Equinix, well beyond electronic trading to accelerate IT transformation across their business
Customer wins across insurance, retail banking and FinTech included a leading French health insurance company, doing real-time risk pricing, and a top 10 retail bank connecting to multiple clouds to support digital banking
The financial services vertical also continues to innovate and grow the customers such as COBOL who is providing secure post-trade processing solutions with Equinix's Performance Hub in global locations
The content and digital media verticals saw its highest bookings in two years led by e-commerce and content deployment as digital transformation is also reshaping this vertical
Content and digital media companies are broadening their use cases, leveraging Platform Equinix for both service provider and enterprise use case
Expansions including a Fortune 500 global entertainment provider deploying a next-generation gaming service, a top 10 streaming video service providing OTT delivery to support live TV services as well as Tencent who is expanding across Platform Equinix to support multi-cloud consumption
The cloud and IT services vertical saw continued momentum in bookings led by software and IT services
Our strategy is to become the home of the interconnected cloud, by increasing density and coverage of software-as-a-service providers and making it easy for enterprises to find and consume cloud services
We have over 2,800 cloud and IT service provider customers which now include over 1,000 software and software-as-a-service providers
Expansions in the quarter feature use cases for Security-as-a-Service, risk intelligence and managed services supporting multi-cloud
Customers leveraging these and other hybrid multi-cloud solutions include the top systems integrator Deloitte and the managed services provider, T-Systems
And turning to enterprise, this vertical remained our fastest growing with a record number of new logos and Fortune 500 wins
We're seeing double-digit growth in many of our sub segments including manufacturing, travel, healthcare, and government across a variety of use cases
For example, manufacturers are leveraging Equinix to transform network topology and localize traffic to improve performance, reduce cost and enable digital supply chains
We're currently working with a large number of global automobile manufacturers as they deploy infrastructure to support connected car initiatives
We see this trend developing into an ecosystem of information and content suppliers as new autonomous driving platforms are developed and deployed
This quarter, manufacturing customer wins included a Fortune 500 manufacturer deploying autonomous vehicle and IoT capabilities at the edge and Weyerhaeuser, a Fortune 350 manufacturer transforming their supply chain management to digital
We also saw a win in the healthcare segment with Shire, a leading pharmaceutical company connecting multiple clouds to use distributed analytics and hybrid data storage
Our channel efforts continue to bear fruit in our pursuit of enterprise business
Partner contributions to bookings grew for the 13th sequential quarter and now account for 17% with two-thirds of this activity from resellers
Our focused efforts on partner activation and joint offer development are driving more and more productivity
Partners are expanding our distribution and embedding Equinix into larger enterprise solution bundles
Reseller integrated solutions like Performance Hub are delivering more volume and more predictable deal flow
Enterprise new adds jumped up significantly year-over-year with 44% of these customers coming from our indirect channel
We are achieving our bookings targets with a growing base of smaller partner deals, building a more predictable and repeatable engine for enterprise pursuit
So in summary, I am pleased with our business performance this quarter and we continue to leverage the substantial benefits of our global reach and interconnected ecosystems
We remain highly confident that the Verizon transaction will create significant value for both our customers and our shareholders and create new opportunities as we build on these enterprise-rich assets
Going forward, we remain focused on our top three priorities: pressing our advantage, catching the next wave, and scaling our organization, all of which will enable Equinix to continue to capture the shift to the cloud and accelerate new customer wins
As part of our alignment around these priorities, Charles Meyers has taken a new role as President of Strategy, Services, and Innovation, leveraging his deep experience and knowledge of our business to lead the strategic business teams driving the company's next phase of growth
I look forward to continuing to work closely with Charles and the rest of the team to sharpen our focus on meeting the evolving and dynamic customer requirements that we face in the marketplace today
So, now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter and forward-looking guidance
I'm happy to, Keith
Jeffrey, the M&A since you're new to the story, you may not realize that over the 18-plus years, we've actually done about 18 acquisitions in our history, most recently of course of Verizon, which you heard some color on today
But our main driver for acquisition activity, it usually follows a couple of big things
It's extending our networking cloud platform, that's a top priority for us and second, we're reaching new markets
And normally big sophisticated customers who will provide us opportunity, for example, big cloud providers to look at emerging markets
Our strategy historically has been focused on extending this thing we refer to as Platform Equinix
And there is three dimensions that normally are filters that we look at very closely, entering new markets as I just said, enhancing our interconnections is a second filter that we look very closely at
So, if we can deepen our interconnection like we did with the Verizon NOTA asset that Keith just talked about, that's a big factor for an acquisition filter for us
And then thirdly, if we can deepen and widen the cloud ecosystem that you heard so much about in the script, that's a big factor
New markets probably would include deeper into Southeast Asia, South Korea has been and will continue to be attractive for us
India is a big market we're not in today, we are continuing to study that market
And we're starting to see the big cloud providers going to South Africa and deeper into Latin America, so those are all of interest
Let me add – Charles, let me add here, I'm sorry I'm remote guys, but I think to Keith's points and Charles' comments earlier guys, Paul and team, we shouldn't underestimate just the concept of catching the next wave
And as Charles – I mean, this decision to move our Chief Operating Officer to lead creating more options for our future is at the heart of your question you're asking here, Paul, where is the market shifting
And so driving the next generation of interconnection, the next wave of cloud architectures shifting, this concept of edge computing is moving
All these things getting connected to the internet are going to cause more opportunity for Equinix
Everything is getting redefined by software, storage, security, networking
So all of these activities, Charles is going to have teams of people focused on these – already has people
We're going to combine them into one organization now to make sure that we're just looking further out and faster to create opportunity for our customers
The number one thing our customers are asking us for us to help them with this digital transformation that's taking place around the world at the top of the list
And so, that's at the heart of the market shift
Hey, Jonathan
And let me add one or two more things to Charles' point that I think are important
Verizon, in particular the Federal business, which I think most people in the call realize we're still in the process of clearing all the Federal Classified business, which is currently managed through TSA by Verizon
Once we get our clearances completed and all the appropriate innovation then we'll move forward with that
We are going to invest in a deeper bigger federal team
So, Karl Strohmeyer, who leads our Americas businesses is full speed ahead with that today
We pick up obviously this Verizon Federal business which will basically double our business
And so, it will give us a substantial footprint into the government segment that we haven't had in the past and we're pretty excited about that
We're moving as fast as we can with the clearances and the positioning for that
And then, just one other piece, on the wholesale question that you had which is not a phrase that we use a lot around Equinix, but Charles is going to have accountability for really watching that next wave of cloud with his new team, and as he stated, we will start to play in a different way as we move to the next several quarters and years, as the next wave of cloud unfolds and we look at where these aggregation points and the edge goes, et cetera, et cetera
So, you'll probably see Equinix taking a more active role in positioning ourselves for extending the interconnection footprint to where these aggregation points matter, and how they evolve with and how the edge moves, and how these hyperscalers deploy this next wave of computing
So, I would tell you to stay tuned
Great, Colby
So let me take the first one
As I said in my prepared remarks, we've taken a very prudent view as it relates to the Verizon assets having only wholly-owned or build to customers for the first two months since the transaction close
We've taken a prudent view to make sure that we continue to have appropriate sales reserves, even more so, continue to make an assumption and there's an underlying assumption that we will continue to see churn in the Verizon business, notwithstanding the fact that we had some nice momentum in our bookings in the second quarter
And so one it's just about being prudent
Again, we don't have the history, the customers are receiving invoices from Equinix for the very first time broken out in our format, and we taken a point of view, this is a range and we're going to guide you to that
And what I would just say is, as it relates to – look, if we don't need the reserves then we're going to be moving towards the top end of the range
To the extent we need the reserves then we're going to keep you inside the range
But it just gives us great comfort that we've got a prudent view on what we think the numbers could be
Again, our focus is going to be to not let that happen but, as you know, again, we don't have the history with the Verizon customers
As it relates to AFFO, again, it's timing of expenses
Not only it relates to the organic business but more specifically the Verizon business
And if you recall, when we bought the asset, it was an asset purchase and for all intents and purposes we had some transition services agreement with Verizon
But there is an underlying assumption that we make a heavy investment in the cost model through Q3 and Q4, and that's having an impact on the AFFO and hence EBITDA
Again, there's an assumption, we're going to hire a lot more heads and we're going to do a lot more R&M
Two things that were not particularly prevalent inside the Verizon, the Verizon asset portfolio prior to our acquisition, so those are the reasons
So, again, stay tuned to the third quarter
We're excited about what we're doing
And again, if we can get our hands around it, I'm optimistic that it's just a prudent reserve that's in place
Well, as Charles said, all those areas we are customer and market sensing, have been for a couple, well, few years now
And we're going to collect those organizations under this new organization with Charles
And, yes, all those things you mentioned are happening
And so we've lived with six years or seven years of a wave, we call it kind of the first wave in cloud and we think there's another wave coming
Obviously, the big hyperscalers and the cloud providers have learned from their first wave of deployments
And so, how that architecture is going to look the next wave, is going to be different
They're going to start doing in their emerging countries
They've learned from their first several years of deployment on how to install their availability zones and their network nodes, and their access points, and their private connections
And so, there is a shift in the architecture and the edge of their deployment is shifting
And so, we're watching all that
We're working very closely with all of them, as you guys know
And yes, we want to position to move quickly as they continue to deploy and we think it's still very, very early
And I think the other side of that will be these IoT edge control points, if you will, they're going to start to form
All these things are going to be connected to the cloud and are going to require storage, networking and server infrastructure all over the world to drive connected cars, connected tractors, sensors, cameras, all these things that are going to get connected to the cloud and to the internet
So, all of those things Charles has all the teams that are watching all that and we're market and customers sensing those as fast as we can to make sure that we can provide products and services for the next generation of all that stuff and at the heart of that is interconnection and ecosystems
