Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2017 financial results conference call
Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements
Actual results may differ materially
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures
In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC
Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements
It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance
Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to a new accounting rule that we implemented in Q1. The new rule requires excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows
We retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to re-classify excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities
And as a result, you will see an increase in our free cash flow measures for prior periods
Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the excess tax benefit or deficiency for stock-based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense rather than equity
This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per share
Specific changes are presented in the footnotes to the consolidated statement of cash flows and related metrics provided in our press release
Further disclosure of the impact of the adoption of this accounting change can be found in our Form 10-Q
With that, we will move to Q&A
Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question Question-and-Answer Session
Yeah, on a deferred revenue balances, as we've said in the past, the primary drivers of that increase are both the activity that we're seeing with our AWS customers and the purchase of Reserved Instances and prepaid credits for their account, as well as Prime member purchases
We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime, but certainly it – we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we have seen over the last quarter or so
Certainly, the – part of that increase in deferred balances is related to Reserved Instances
As customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained workloads into the AWS services through buying RIs, they're able to get fairly significant discounts on their usage
And so we like that model
Customers certainly like that model
And collecting that through deferred revenue and then letting customers use that over time is very helpful
Hi, Jason
This is Darin
Yes, we, a number of quarters back, started breaking out stock-based compensation by segment, and now we have collapsed that in our op income by segment
So it's definitely in there
We do provide some disclosure by P&L line item on a consolidated basis, that helps you identify that stock-based compensation expense in total and you'll see the trend and analysis and the metrics at the back of the press release
Thank you for joining us on our call today and for your questions
A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter
We appreciate your interest in Amazon
com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter
